    <h1>Animal Farm</h1>
    <p id="animal farm">
      Animal Farm is a beast fable,[1] in the form of a satirical allegorical
      novella, by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August
      1945.[2][3] It tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic farm animals
      who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the
      animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is
      betrayed and, under the dictatorship of a pig named Napoleon, the farm
      ends up in a state as bad as it was before. According to Orwell, Animal
      Farm reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then
      on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union, a period of time when
      Russia lived under the communist ideology of Joseph Stalin.[1][4] Orwell,
      a democratic socialist,[5] was a critic of Stalin and hostile to
      Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his
      experiences during the Barcelona May Days conflicts between the POUM and
      Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War.[6][a] In a letter to Yvonne
      Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin
      ("un conte satirique contre Staline"),[7] and in his essay "Why I Write"
      (1946), wrote: "Animal Farm was the first book in which I tried, with full
      consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic
      purpose into one whole".[8] The original title was Animal Farm: A Fairy
      Story, but US publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in
      1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime, the
      Telugu version, kept it. Other title variations include subtitles like "A
      Satire" and "A Contemporary Satire".[7] Orwell suggested the title Union
      des républiques socialistes animales for the French translation, which
      abbreviates to URSA, the Latin word for "bear", a symbol of Russia. It
      also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, Union des républiques
      socialistes soviétiques.[7]

    <h1>Plot summary</h1>
    <p id="potal">
      The animal populace of the poorly run Manor Farm near Willingdon, England,
      is ripened for rebellion by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and
      alcoholic farmer, Mr. Jones. One night, the exalted boar, Old Major, holds
      a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches
      the animals a revolutionary song called "Beasts of England". When Old
      Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and
      stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property
      "Animal Farm". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most
      important of which is, "All animals are equal". The decree is painted in
      large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to
      read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of
      Animalism. To commemorate the start of Animal Farm, Snowball raises a
      green flag with a white hoof and horn. Food is plentiful, and the farm
      runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and
      set aside special food items, ostensibly for their health. Following an
      unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm
      (later dubbed the "Battle of the Cowshed"), Snowball announces his plans
      to modernise the farm by building a windmill. Napoleon disputes this idea,
      and matters come to a head, which culminates in Napoleon's dogs chasing
      Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme
      commander.

    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <p id="chapter">
      Old Major – An aged prize Middle White boar provides the inspiration that
      fuels the rebellion. He is also called Willingdon Beauty when showing. He
      is an allegorical combination of Karl Marx, one of the creators of
      communism, and Vladimir Lenin, the communist leader of the Russian
      Revolution and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles
      of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls
      Lenin, whose embalmed body was left in indefinite repose.[16] By the end
      of the book, the skull is reburied. Napoleon – "A large, rather
      fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of
      a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way".[17] An allegory
      of Joseph Stalin,[16] Napoleon is the leader of Animal Farm. Snowball –
      Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones's overthrow.
      His life parallels that of Leon Trotsky,[16] although there is no
      reference to Snowball having been murdered (as Trotsky was); he may also
      combine some elements from Lenin.[18][c] Squealer – A small, white, fat
      porker who serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of
      propaganda, is a collective portrait of the Soviet nomenklatura and
      journalists, such as of the national daily Pravda (The Truth), able to
      justify every twist and turn in Stalin's policy.[16] Minimus – A poetic
      pig who writes the second national anthem of Animal Farm after the singing
      of "Beasts of England" is banned; later he composes a poem "Comrade
      Napoleon". Literary theorist John Rodden compares him to the poet Vladimir
      Mayakovsky,[19] who eulogized Lenin and the Soviet Union, although
      Mayakovsky neither wrote anthems nor praised Stalin in his poems. The
      piglets – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first
      generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality. The
      young pigs – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm
      but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in
      Napoleon's farm purge. Probably based on the Great Purge of Grigory
      Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin, and Alexei Rykov. Pinkeye – A
      minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the taste-tester that samples
      Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours
      about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <p id="Analysis">
      Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into "a complete
      system of thought", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric
      reference to Communism, not to be confused with the philosophy of
      Animalism. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities
      associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading),
      which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is
      employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation,
      an allusion to the Soviet government's revising of history to exercise
      control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society
